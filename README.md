# Inversia
Minecraft dimension mod.

This mod adds a dimension which lays beneath the overworld's bedrock layer, and above the nether's bedrock layer.

Entering this dimension can be achieved via multiple methods, which include: 
- Consuming chorus fruit while standing on the bedrock layer of the overworld.
- Reaching Y350 in the nether
- Running the command: /execute in inversia:inversiadim run tp ~ 222 ~

Leaving this dimension can be done in three ways:
- Death
- Falling into the void teleports you to above the nether roof
- Consuming chorus fruit right below the inversia roof.
